# Fabrication Specification: "Talus Twin-Ram" Hood System

**Project Phase:** Future Development (Post-Phase 1)
**Status:** Design Locked
**Component:** Hood / Air Induction / Lighting
**Design Style:** "Armored Prototype" (Faceted & Bezeled)

---

## 1. Design Overview
A custom-fabricated hood system transforming the stock 1988 Bronco II hood into an active air management system. The design rejects organic curves in favor of "Stealth Fighter" facets to match the MOVE bumpers, creating a "Valley-and-Peak" topography on the front end.

**Core Philosophy:**
* **Aesthetic:** "Military Industrial." Looks like heavy armor plate, not stamped sheet metal.
* **Function:** Active Ram-Air induction with integrated water separation for Colorado weather.
* **Signature:** "The Furnace" – Internal lighting that makes the intake mesh glow Molten Orange.

## 2. Geometry & Construction

### 2.1. The Scoop Body (The "Twin-Ram")
* **Location:** Mounted in the "Side Valleys" of the hood, flanking the central factory bulge.
* **Shape:** Asymmetric Faceted Trapezoid.
    * **Inboard Wall:** Vertical (90°) – Defines the center "power bulge."
    * **Outboard Wall:** Angled (45°) – Matches the fender slope and bumper wings.
    * **Roof:** Flat Horizontal Plane.
    * **Profile:** Wedge shape, rising from flush at the front to approx. 2.0" height at the rear.
* **Material:** 18ga Cold Rolled Steel.
* **Mounting:** Fully TIG stitched and body-worked into the hood skin (Seamless/Stamped look).

### 2.2. The Armored Bezel (The Edge)
To prevent the "thin sheet metal" look, the front opening is framed with a heavy structural rim.
* **Material:** 3/8" or 1/2" Steel Hydraulic Line / Brake Line.
* **Technique:** The "Pac-Man" Miter.
    1.  Tube is slit lengthwise.
    2.  Corners are **Miter Cut** (Sharp 45° joints), NOT bent.
    3.  Slotted tube slides over the raw sheet metal edge of the scoop mouth.
    4.  Welded and ground smooth.
* **Visual Effect:** Creates a "Bullnose" radius that looks like 1/2" thick armor plate.

## 3. Water Management System (The "Colorado Protocol")
**Constraint:** Front-facing scoops catch rain/snow at 65 MPH. Direct ingestion must be prevented.

**Mechanism: The "Dam & Drain"**
1.  **The False Floor:** The scoop floor acts as a ramp. It does *not* open directly into the engine bay.
2.  **The Internal Dam:** A vertical steel wall (1.0" high) is welded around the actual intake hole cut into the hood skin.
3.  **Separation Physics:**
    * **Air:** Hits the back of the scoop, jumps *over* the dam, and enters the engine bay.
    * **Water/Slush:** Hits the back wall, drops to the floor *outside* the dam, and pools.
4.  **Drainage:** 1/4" nipples welded to the rear corners of the scoop floor. Vacuum lines route this water to the fender wells.

## 4. Finish Specification

**The "Furnace" Palette:**
* **Hood Skin:** **Tuxedo Black** (Gloss).
* **Scoop Body:** **Tuxedo Black** (Gloss). *Blended to look like one complex stamping.*
* **Scoop Throat (Interior):** **Satin Black** (High Temp). *Creates infinite depth.*
* **Debris Mesh:** **Molten Orange**. *Perforated Hexagon Steel Mesh set deep in the shadow.*
* **Armored Bezel:** **Steel-It** (Grey). *Highlights the mitered tube fabrication; looks like a bolted-on mechanical component.*

## 5. Lighting Integration ("The Furnace")

**Concept:** The scoops are not just air intakes; they are the vehicle's signature "Running Lights."

### 5.1. Scoop Glow
* **Hardware:** Waterproof IP67 Amber LED Strip (cut to length).
* **Mounting:** Hidden behind the "Internal Dam," facing *forward* towards the mesh.
* **Effect:** Indirect lighting. You do not see the LED chips. You only see the **Molten Orange Mesh** glowing from within, like a jet afterburner or heating element.
* **Circuit:** Connected to **Parking Lights** (DIN 58 / Output 3).

### 5.2. Raptor Markers (Optional)
* **Hardware:** 3x 3/4" Smoked Amber Bullet LEDs.
* **Location:** Installed into the leading edge of the hood or the center bulge trim.
