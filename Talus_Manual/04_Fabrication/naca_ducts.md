# Fabrication Procedure: Hammer Formed Steel NACA Ducts

**Project Phase:** Future Development (Post-Phase 1)
**Status:** Planned
**Component:** Hood / Air Induction System
**Fabrication Method:** Manual Hammer Form (Cold Rolled Steel)

---

## 1. Overview
To increase engine cooling and/or provide cold air induction for the V8 swap without using prone-to-cracking fiberglass fillers. This procedure outlines the creation of custom steel NACA ducts integrated directly into the factory steel hood.

**Design Philosophy:**
* **Material Consistency:** Steel-on-steel welding prevents thermal expansion cracking common with fiberglass grafts.
* **Skill Demonstration:** High-value content for "Project Talus" channel (Hammer forming vs. buying).
* **Functionality:** Ducts must be placed in laminar flow zones (proven by testing) and manage water ingress.

## 2. Prerequisites & Data Collection

Before cutting metal, aerodynamic and clearance data must be verified.

### 2.1. Aerodynamic Verification (Tuft Testing)
* **Objective:** Identify zones of "Attached Flow" (Laminar) vs. "Separated Flow" (Turbulence) on the hood surface.
* **Method:**
    1.  Grid hood with painter's tape (6" spacing).
    2.  Attach 3" yarn tufts (high contrast color) to grid intersections.
    3.  **Road Test:** Record video from roof (top-down) and passenger door (side-profile) at 30, 45, and 65 MPH.
* **Analysis:**
    * **Green Zone:** Tufts lie flat and straight. (Approved for Intake).
    * **Red Zone:** Tufts flap or spin. (Do not place ducts here).
    * **Dead Zone:** Tufts point forward (Cowl high-pressure zone).

### 2.2. Mechanical Clearance (The V8 Factor)
* **Constraint:** The V8 intake plenum/carb hat sits significantly higher than the stock V6.
* **Clearance Check:**
    * Install V8 engine on permanent mounts.
    * Place modeling clay on the highest engine points.
    * Close hood to measure available clearance.
    * *Note:* NACA ducts are **recessed**; ensure the "bucket" of the duct does not hit the valve covers or intake.

## 3. Tooling & Materials

### 3.1. The Buck (Forming Tool)
* **Base Material:** 3/4" MDF or Hardwood (Oak/Maple preferred for durability).
* **Clamping Ring:** 3/4" Plywood or MDF (Matching cutout).
* **Hardware:** 4x 3/8" Carriage Bolts (to clamp the sandwich).

### 3.2. The Part
* **Sheet Metal:** 18ga or 20ga Cold Rolled Steel (matches 1980s Ford body steel).
* **Consumables:** 3M Blue Dykem layout fluid, TIG filler rod (ER70S-6), Cardboard for templates.

## 4. Fabrication Procedure

### 4.1. Making the Buck
1.  **Trace:** Layout the standard NACA airfoil shape on the base wood.
2.  **Route (The Ramp):**
    * The NACA duct floor is a **ramp**, not a hole.
    * **Wide End (Inlet):** Deepest point (approx. 1.0" - 1.5").
    * **Narrow End (Tip):** Flush with surface.
    * Use a router or die grinder to carve this graduated slope smoothly.
3.  **Edge Radius:** Round over the top edge of the form (1/8" to 1/4" radius). *Sharp edges will shear the metal.*

### 4.2. Hammer Forming
1.  **Sandwich:** Place the steel blank between the Base Buck and the Clamping Ring. Bolt tighter than necessary.
2.  **Anneal (Optional):** If using 18ga, spot anneal the deep drop area with a torch to prevent tearing.
3.  **The Hit:**
    * Use a Ball Peen hammer or plastic heavy mallet.
    * Start at the **Deep End (Inlet)**. Do not try to stretch it all at once.
    * Work the metal down into the corner radius slowly ("Tuck and shrink" method).
    * Work back toward the shallow tip.
4.  **Finishing:** Use a planishing hammer or slapper to smooth the floor of the duct against the wood.

### 4.3. Cutting & Trimming
1.  Once fully formed, leave the metal in the buck.
2.  Use a cutoff wheel to slice the vertical wall at the **Wide Inlet** end.
3.  Remove from buck.
4.  Trim the outer flange to 1.0" (for welding surface).

## 5. Installation Strategy

### 5.1. The Graft
1.  **Layout:** Transfer the cutout shape to the "Green Zone" on the hood.
2.  **Flanging:** Use a pneumatic flange tool or step-pliers on the hood hole to create a recessed step equal to the metal thickness.
3.  **Welding:**
    * Place the formed duct into the flanged hole.
    * **Tack:** Every 1 inch. Cool with compressed air immediately to prevent warping.
    * **Stitch:** Connect tacks using the "skip weld" technique (jump around to manage heat).
    * **Finish:** Grind flush, verify no pinholes.

### 5.2. Water Management (Crucial for Daily Driver)
Since the vehicle operates in Colorado weather, water ingress must be managed.
* **The Drip Pan:** Fabricate a small tray welded to the **underside** of the hood, directly below the duct opening.
* **Drainage:** Weld a 1/4" nipple to the lowest point of the pan. Run a rubber vacuum line to the fender well to drain water.
* **Airflow:** The air velocity allows it to "jump" the drip pan gap into the engine bay/airbox, while heavier water falls into the trap.

## 6. Functional Configuration

**Option A: Engine Bay Cooling (V6/V8 Street)**
* **Left Duct:** Directed at Master Cylinder/Power Distribution Box.
* **Right Duct:** Directed at Alternator/Exhaust Headers.
* *Goal:* Evacuate stagnant hot air from the engine bay.

**Option B: Cold Air Induction (V8 Performance)**
* **Fabrication:** Create a sealed "Y-Pipe" plenum under the hood connecting both ducts to the carburetor/throttle body hat.
* *Goal:* True Ram-Air effect.
