# Project Talus: Master Interior Design Specification (v2.1)
**Vehicle:** 1988 Ford Bronco II
**Theme:** "SVT Raptor" meets "Aviation Cockpit"
**Core Logic:** Modular "LRU" (Line Replaceable Unit) Construction

## 1. Design Language & Color Strategy
* **Primary Aesthetic:** Industrial / Billet / Technical.
* **The "Cockpit" Rule:** The Driver’s Control Zone (Dash, Center Console, Overhead) uses **Brushed Aluminum** + **Molten Orange** accents to signify "Flight Controls."
* **The "Truck" Rule:** The rest of the cabin (Door Inlays, Cargo Area) uses **Satin Black** + **Black Hardware** to recede visually and emphasize utility.
* **The Accent:** **Molten Orange** (Anodized Washers & Upholstery Stitching) ties into the exterior paint.

## 2. Floor System: "Tactical Hard Deck"
**Concept:** A zero-slip, mechanically anchored floor system using military-grade fasteners for *all* mats.

### Material Spec
* **Mat Material:** **WeatherTech Heavy Duty (HD)** Trim-to-Fit (7/8" thick rubber composite).
* **Underlayment:** **DynaDeck** (Waterproof Vintage Texture) installed wall-to-wall.

### Anchoring Strategy ("Option A")
* **The Hardware:** **Lift-the-Dot Directional Fasteners** (Black Oxide Finish).
    * *Why:* These only unlock when lifted from one specific direction ("The Dot"). They cannot slide under pedals.
* **Installation Method:** **Through-Floor Anchoring**.
    * **Driver, Passenger & Rear Mats:** Use **Screw-Studs** drilled directly through the mat, through the DynaDeck, and *into the steel floor pan*.
    * *Result:* The mats become structural fixtures of the truck but can be snapped out for cleaning.
* **Rear Seat Backs:** Use **Fabric-to-Wood Studs** screwed into the ABS backing board of the seat.

## 3. Roll Cage: "Sandwich Plate" Tie-Ins
**Concept:** Distributing cage loads through the unibody floor without ripping the thin sheet metal ("Tuna Can" effect).

### Fabrication Spec
* **The Plate System:** 4-Bolt Sandwich Design.
    * **Top Plate:** 3/16" Steel welded to the Cage Foot.
    * **Bottom Plate:** 3/16" Steel located *under* the body tub.
    * **The Sandwich:** 4x Grade 8 Bolts clamp the body sheet metal between these two plates.
* **The Aesthetic Detail:** **Dimple Die Holes**.
    * If the plates are visible (e.g., on wheel wells), use Dimple Dies on the gussets to add rigidity and match the "Aviation lightening hole" look.
* **Finish:** Powder Coated **Satin Black** (to disappear into the floor) or **Molten Orange** (if you want to highlight the cage feet as a feature).

## 4. The Consoles: "Control Centers"
**Concept:** Custom aluminum housings that carry the "Cockpit" aesthetic (Brushed Alum + Orange Washers) between the seats and overhead.

### Center Console (Custom Fab)
* **Structure:** "Spacer Frame" Construction (Matches Door Pockets).
    * **Walls:** 0.125" Brushed Aluminum side panels.
    * **Core:** 1" Black HDPE spacers separating the walls.
* **Features:**
    * **Switch Panel:** Horizontal "Cockpit" plate for Aux Lighting/Winch controls.
    * **Shifters:** Booted openings for Transmission & Transfer Case.
    * **Armrest:** Padded Black Vinyl (Orange Stitch) matching the door cards.
* **Hardware:** **M6 Black Flat Head Screws + Orange Washers** (Visible from sides).

### Overhead Console (Radio Stack)
* **Mounting:** Clamps directly to the Roll Cage top bars (no drilling into the roof skin).
* **Face:** 45-degree angled faceplate facing the driver.
* **Equipment:**
    * CB/GMRS Radio.
    * Map Lights (Red/White Aviation style).
    * Rear Locker Switches (Safety covers).
* **Finish:** Brushed Aluminum Faceplate bolted to a **Satin Black** enclosure box.

## 5. The Dashboard ("The Cockpit")
**Concept:** Segmented aluminum faceplates bolted to a sub-frame.

### Hardware Recipe ("Flush Mount")
* **Anchors:** **M6 Steel Rivnuts** installed in the dash structure.
* **Washers:** **M6 Anodized Orange Countersunk Washers**.
* **Bolts:** **M6 Black Oxide Stainless Steel Flat Head Socket Screws**.
* **Effect:** The screw head sits perfectly flush inside the orange washer, creating a smooth "aero" surface.

## 6. The Door Cards ("Tactical Panels")
**Concept:** Tri-layer construction for depth.

### Layer Stack
1.  **Base:** ABS Plastic or Aluminum wrapped in **Black Vinyl**.
2.  **Infill:** **Black Anodized Aluminum** (Top half).
3.  **Armrest:** Steel-core box with Brushed Aluminum Switch Plate.
4.  **Pocket:** Laser-cut **MOLLE Grid** (Wrinkle Black) spaced off the door with **1.5" HDPE Frame**.

## 7. Fabrication Data (1988 Spec)
**Note:** Use these dimensions to generate the CAD "Master Blank" for the door cards.

### Door Card Envelope (1988 Model)
* **Width:** 44.0" (Hinge to Latch).
* **Height:** 15.0" (Flat section below window felt).
* **Material Thickness:** 0.063" (1/16") Aluminum (Recommended for stiffness).
* **Profile:** 0.5" Radius on bottom corners; 90-degree or 0.125" radius on top corners.

### Key Hard Points (Reference from Front/Top Edge)
* **Window Crank/Switch:** ~8.0" Back / 4.0" Down.
* **Door Release Handle:** ~6.0" Back / 8.0" Down.
* **Armrest Anchors:** Located centrally (Transfer exact spacing from physical door shell).

## 8. Next Actions
* [ ] **Order Floor Hardware:** 40x Black Oxide Lift-the-Dot Screw Studs (Enough for all 4 mats + cargo).
* [ ] **Design Sandwich Plates:** Measure cage tubing diameter and floor pan contours.
* [ ] **Order Console Materials:** 2'x4' sheet of 1" HDPE (for console spacers) + 4'x8' sheet of 5052 Aluminum.
* [ ] **Select Roll Cage Tubing:** Confirm 1.75" DOM for main hoop.
