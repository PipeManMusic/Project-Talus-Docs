# Fabrication Specification: 4-Point Half Cage & Safety Systems

**Project Phase:** Future Development (Post-Phase 1)
**Status:** Planned
**Component:** Interior / Safety
**Fabrication Style:** "Project Talus" Industrial (Function-First)

---

## 1. Design Overview
A 4-point internal roll cage designed to provide rollover protection for front occupants without compromising street drivability, dashboard functionality, or HVAC vent airflow. This design rejects the full 6-point cage to preserve the "Cockpit" aesthetic and daily utility.

**Core Philosophy:**
* **Safety:** Main hoop rigidity + C-pillar triangulation.
* **Ergonomics:** No A-pillar bars to obstruct entry/exit or vision.
* **Restraint:** Integration of inertia-reel harnesses for street-legal comfort and trail safety.
* **Aesthetic:** "Industrial Neutral" (Steel-It Grey) to contrast with Molten Orange accents.

## 2. Structural Specifications

### 2.1. Material
* **Tubing:** 1.75" x .120" DOM (Drawn Over Mandrel) Steel.
* **Plates:** 3/16" or 1/4" Cold Rolled Steel (Floor plates sandwiching the body tub).

### 2.2. Geometry (4-Point Layout)
1.  **Main Hoop (B-Pillar):**
    * Positioned immediately behind the front seats.
    * Tucked tight to the headliner and B-pillar trim to maximize interior volume.
    * **Mounting:** Sandwiched plates bolted/welded to the floor structure behind the front seat mounts.
2.  **Rear Kickers (C-Pillar):**
    * Two bars extending from the top corners of the Main Hoop down to the rear wheel wells.
    * **Angle:** Matched to the angle of the rear side windows for visual symmetry.
3.  **Harness Bar (Integrated):**
    * Horizontal cross-bar welded between the Main Hoop uprights.
    * **Height:** Positioned exactly at driver shoulder height (verified with seats installed).
    * *Purpose:* Structural rigidity for the hoop + mounting point for harnesses.
4.  **Brow Bars (Optional):**
    * Short horizontal gusset bars extending forward along the roof line (above the door) to the top of the windshield.
    * *Constraint:* Must NOT extend down the A-pillar or block the sun visors.

## 3. Harness Integration System

**Component:** Corbeau 2-Inch Retractable Harness (3-Point)
**Color:** Black (Standard)

### 3.1. The "Vertical Reel" Fabrication
The inertia reels for these harnesses rely on gravity sensors. They **must** be mounted perfectly vertical to function.
* **The Trap:** The Main Hoop is often raked back slightly. Mounting directly to the hoop will cause the belts to lock permanently.
* **The Solution:** Fabricate custom mounting tabs.
    * **Location:** Weld tabs to the **top** or **rear face** of the Harness Bar.
    * **Alignment:** Use a torpedo level during fabrication to ensure the mounting face is 90° vertical relative to the ground, regardless of cage angle.

### 3.2. Belt Geometry
* **Shoulder Angle:** Webbing must leave the occupant's shoulder at an angle between **0° (Horizontal) and 20° Down**.
* **No Floor Mounts:** Retractors must NOT be mounted to the floor, as this creates dangerous spinal compression during an accident.

## 4. Aesthetic & Finish Strategy

### 4.1. The "Industrial" Palette
* **Cage Finish:** **Steel-It** (Polyurethane Stainless Steel Coating).
    * *Why:* Matches the custom MOVE bumpers and raw mechanical components. Provides a matte, technical look that hides scratches and allows for easy weld repairs.
* **Harness Color:** **Black**.
    * *Why:* Provides high contrast against the Grey cage. Avoids the "clashing grey" effect.
* **Padding:** Black SFI-rated roll bar padding on areas where head impact is possible.

### 4.2. "Talus" Micro-Accents (Molten Orange)
To tie the cage into the wider build theme without overdoing it:
* **Harness Bar Padding:** Wrap the center section of the harness bar padding in **Orange Vinyl** (or use Orange zip-ties for the padding covers).
* **Camera Mount:** Paint the GoPro mount on the harness bar **Molten Orange**.

## 5. Fabrication Checklist
- [ ] Measure seat position for driver comfort (Phase 1).
- [ ] Bend Main Hoop and verify clearance to headliner.
- [ ] Tack Main Hoop and check seat travel.
- [ ] Fabricate and level Inertia Reel mounting tabs (Critical Step).
- [ ] Weld Harness Bar at correct shoulder height.
- [ ] Fit Rear Kickers to match window angle.
- [ ] Fully weld 360° (Drop cage through floor if necessary to weld top side).
- [ ] Prep and spray 3 coats of Steel-It.
- [ ] Install Corbeau Harnesses and test locking mechanism.
