## 2.0 Fabrication Design: Speaker Pods & Amp Box

### 2.1 Front Door Speaker Pods (Custom Composite)
- **Design:** Hand-laid fiberglass pods using an MDF-skeleton removal method to minimize weight.
- **Waterproofing:** Sides of XTC 5"x7" foam baffles integrated into the pod design as a water shield; bottom removed to maintain bass response.
- **Mounting:** Pods integrated directly into an aluminum backing plate bolted to the inner door frame.
- **Acoustics:** Doors fully treated with Dynamat Xtreme to create a proper sealed enclosure.

### 2.2 Flush-Floor Heatsink Box
- **Chassis:** Fabricated 16-gauge steel frame stitch-welded to the floor pan under the rear seat.
- **Heatsink Plate:** 1/8" or 3/16" 6061-T6 Aluminum floor plate (Mill Finish on exterior side).
- **Sealing:** Neoprene perimeter gasket + 3M 4200FC marine sealant + Tef-Gel anti-corrosion paste.
- **Mounting:** Sealed stainless steel studs through-bolted from underneath for nut-access via cab door. Amp mounted with thermal paste for conductive heat transfer.

## 3.0 Electrical Infrastructure & Safety

- **Power Routing:** 4AWG tinned copper cables routed along the interior of the frame rail in liquid-tight flexible conduit. Secured with stainless P-clamps.
- **Safety:** 150A Inline Marine Fuse within 12" of battery terminal.
- **Termination:** Mechanical crimps with adhesive-lined heat shrink; all active components utilize conformal coated PCBs for moisture protection.

## 4.0 Subwoofer Stealth Integration

- **Location:** Integrated into the rear passenger-side quarter panel void (stealth install).
- **Mounting:** Custom steel brackets secured to the body tub; enclosure isolated to prevent metal-to-metal vibration.
- **Acoustic Venting:** Factory plastic panel modified with an opening covered in color-matched acoustic grill cloth for "hidden" bass output.
- **Damping:** Entire quarter panel cavity fully treated with Dynamat Xtreme.

---

## 5.0 Aesthetics & Finishing

- **Chassis Coating:** Exterior of weld-in steel box treated with automotive seam sealer and textured black bed-liner.
- **Interior Finish:** Box lid sits flush with floor; entire interior finished with DynaDeck waterproof matting for a seamless factory look.
- **Service Access:** Sealed access door in the cabin floor for tuning crossovers and gains without seat removal.

## 6.0 Performance Goals

- **Sound Quality:** Active 3-way front stage for high-fidelity stage imaging and detailed vocal reproduction.
- **Robustness:** 100% mud-proof signal path; thermal management via passive external heatsink loop for desert/trail reliability.
- **Serviceability:** Tool-accessible tuning controls and external wiring runs for rapid trailside diagnostics.
